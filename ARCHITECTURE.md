Certainly! I'll create a high-level markdown document that outlines a plan for writing a self-assembling unix pipeline agentic system. I'll include increasingly detailed Mermaid diagrams to illustrate the system's architecture and workflow.

# Self-Assembling Unix Pipeline Agentic System

## 1. Overview

The Self-Assembling Unix Pipeline Agentic System is a framework that combines the power of Unix-style command-line tools with artificial intelligence to create dynamic, adaptive pipelines for various tasks. This system will leverage existing tools and generate new ones as needed, assembling them into efficient workflows.

    C --> D[Execution]
    D --> E[Output]
```

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Agent

The central intelligence that interprets user requests, plans pipelines, and manages the overall workflow.

### 2.2 Tool Registry

A database of available tools, their capabilities, inputs, and outputs.

### 2.3 Pipeline Assembler

Constructs pipelines by combining tools based on the agent's instructions.

### 2.4 Execution Engine

Runs the assembled pipeline and manages data flow between tools.

### 2.5 Tool Generator

Creates new tools when existing ones are insufficient for a task.
