- Assess the overall progress and improvement from previous attempts

For summarizing:
- Provide an overview of all attempts, including the total number and score range
- Highlight key improvements and milestones achieved across attempts
- Identify common challenges or recurring issues
- Offer insights on the overall progress and learning trajectory
