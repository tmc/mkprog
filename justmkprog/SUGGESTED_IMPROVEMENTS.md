# Suggested Improvements for mkprogmkprog

## 1. Implement goimports Functionality
- Reimplement the goimports functionality from the original mkprog to automatically format and organize imports in the generated code.

## 2. Support Multiple AI Models
- Add support for different AI models or providers (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere) to give users more flexibility in choosing their preferred language model.

## 3. Implement Caching Mechanism
- Develop a caching system for AI responses to improve performance and reduce API calls for similar requests.

## 4. Enhance Project Customization
- Add flags for specifying license type, Go version, and project templates (e.g., CLI tool, web server, library).

## 5. Improve Progress Feedback
- Implement a progress bar or more detailed status updates during the generation process, especially for larger programs.

## 6. Automatic Test Generation
- Add an option to automatically generate unit tests for the created program.

## 7. Project Update Functionality
- Implement a feature to update existing programs based on new descriptions or requirements.

## 8. Multi-language Support
- Extend the program to support generating projects in multiple programming languages, not just Go.

## 9. Dry-run Mode
- Implement a dry-run mode that shows what files would be generated without actually creating them.

## 10. Code Validation
- Add a feature to validate the generated code syntax before writing it to files.

## 11. Concurrent Processing
- Implement concurrent file writing using goroutines for improved performance when dealing with multiple files.

## 12. Custom Templates
- Add support for custom templates, allowing users to provide their own project structure and file templates.

## 13. Interactive Mode
- Implement an interactive mode for users to provide project details step-by-step.

## 14. Version Control Integration
- Add functionality to initialize a Git repository for the generated project.

## 15. Containerization Support
- Implement options to generate Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for containerization.

## 16. Code Linting and Formatting
- Integrate code linting and formatting tools (e.g., gofmt, golint) to ensure generated code follows best practices.

## 17. Documentation Generation
- Add support for generating project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

## 18. Dependency Management
- Implement functionality to manage and update project dependencies.

## 19. Performance Optimization
- Profile the application and optimize resource usage, especially for large project generations.

## 20. Plugin System
- Develop a plugin system to allow users to easily extend the program's functionality.

These improvements aim to make mkprogmkprog more versatile, efficient, and user-friendly while maintaining its core functionality as a meta-program for generating Go projects using AI
