<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-1) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Expanded functionality: The new program offers a more comprehensive set of features, including support for multiple AI models, project templates, and a dry-run option.

2. Improved command-line interface: The new program uses the Cobra library for a more robust CLI, with better flag handling and subcommand support.

3. Configuration file support: The new program implements configuration file support using Viper, allowing users to set default values for flags.

4. Enhanced project generation: The new program generates a more complete project structure, including test files and additional packages as needed.

5. Concurrent file writing: The new program implements concurrent file writing using goroutines for improved performance.

6. Progress indicator: A spinner is added to provide visual feedback during content generation.

7. Better error handling: The new program implements more comprehensive error handling and reporting.

8. Dry-run option: Users can preview generated content without creating files.

9. Customizable templates: The new program supports custom project templates and different project types (CLI, web, library).

10. Improved documentation: The README.md file for the new program provides more detailed information about installation, usage, and configuration.

11. Dependency management: The go.mod file in the new program includes additional dependencies required for the enhanced functionality.

12. Code organization: The new program's code is better organized, with clear separation of concerns and modular design.

Overall, the new program offers a more feature-rich, flexible, and user-friendly solution for generating Go project structures based on user descriptions.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider implementing the following features:

1. Add support for more AI models, such as OpenAI and Cohere, as mentioned in the project description.

2. Implement a caching system to store and reuse previously generated content for similar project requests.

3. Add functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

4. Implement a plugin system to allow users to extend the program's functionality easily.

5. Add an interactive mode for users to provide project details step-by-step.

6. Implement version control system integration (e.g., Git) to initialize the project repository.

7. Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for containerization.

8. Implement a code linting and formatting step using tools like gofmt and golint.

9. Add an option to generate project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

10. Implement dependency management functionality to manage and update project dependencies.

11. Profile the application and optimize resource usage, especially for large project generations.

These enhancements would bring the program closer to the full set of features described in the original prompt and make it an even more powerful tool for generating Go project structures.
