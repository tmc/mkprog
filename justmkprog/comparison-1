<comparison>
The new program (mkprog) is an implementation of the original program's functionality, with some modifications and improvements. Here's a comparison of the two:

Similarities:
1. Both use the langchaingo library to interact with AI language models.
2. Both implement error handling using the run() pattern.
3. Both use embedded system prompts.
4. Both support custom temperature settings for AI generation.
5. Both include options for running goimports on generated code.
6. Both generate structured content based on user input.

Differences and Improvements:
1. Scope: The new program is more focused on generating complete Go projects, while the original was more general-purpose.
2. Input handling: The new program accepts a program name and description as separate arguments, making it more specific to project generation.
3. Output handling: The new program has a more robust file writing system, capable of handling multiple files with proper headers.
4. Flags: The new program includes additional flags like -max-tokens and -verbose, providing more control over the generation process.
5. Input file: The new program includes an -f flag for specifying an input file, with stdin as the default.
6. Output directory: The new program has an -o flag for specifying the output directory.
7. Streaming: The new program implements streaming output for generated content, which was a suggestion in the original system prompt.
8. Error messages: The new program provides more detailed error messages and better usage instructions.
9. Logging: The new program includes verbose logging options for better debugging and user feedback.
10. Code structure: The new program's code is more modular, with separate functions for reading input, writing files, and running goimports.

Overall, the new program is a more specialized and feature-rich implementation of the original concept, tailored specifically for generating complete Go projects based on user input.

To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Add support for custom templates: Allow users to provide their own system prompts or templates for different types of projects.

2. Implement concurrent file writing: Use goroutines to write multiple files simultaneously, potentially speeding up the process for large projects.

3. Add a dry-run option: Allow users to preview the generated content without actually creating files.

4. Implement a progress bar: For large generations, provide visual feedback on the generation progress.

5. Add support for different AI models: Allow users to choose between different language models or providers.

6. Implement caching: Store frequently used prompts or generations to reduce API calls and improve performance.

7. Add unit tests: Implement comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability and ease future development.

8. Implement a config file: Allow users to set default values for flags in a configuration file.

9. Add support for generating project-specific files: Based on the project type, automatically include relevant files like Dockerfiles, CI/CD configs, or language-specific config files.

10. Implement an interactive mode: Guide users through the project creation process with a series of questions, potentially using a TUI library for a more user-friendly experience.

These suggestions aim to make the program more flexible, efficient, and user-friendly while maintaining its core functionality.
