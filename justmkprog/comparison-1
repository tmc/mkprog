<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-1) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Expanded functionality: The new program offers more features, including support for different AI models, project templates, and a dry-run option.

2. Improved command-line interface: It uses the Cobra library for a more robust CLI, with better flag handling and command structure.

3. Configuration file support: The new program implements a configuration file system using Viper, allowing users to store default values.

4. Enhanced project generation: It generates a complete project structure with main package, additional packages, test files, README.md, and go.mod.

5. Concurrent file writing: The new program implements concurrent file writing using goroutines for improved performance.

6. Progress indicator: It includes a spinner to show progress during content generation.

7. Structured output: The generated content is structured as JSON, making it easier to parse and process.

8. Better error handling: The new program has more comprehensive error handling and provides more informative error messages.

9. Improved modularity: The code is better organized with separate functions for different tasks, improving maintainability.

10. Additional dependencies: The new program uses more external libraries (e.g., Cobra, Viper, spinner) to enhance functionality.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, user-friendly, and adheres better to Go best practices and idiomatic patterns.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement unit tests for the main functions to ensure reliability and ease of maintenance.

2. Add support for custom plugins or extensions to allow users to extend the functionality of the program.

3. Implement a caching system to store and reuse previously generated content, improving performance for similar project descriptions.

4. Add an option to generate documentation in various formats (e.g., Markdown, HTML, man pages) for the created project.

5. Implement a feature to analyze existing Go projects and suggest improvements or updates based on best practices.

6. Add support for generating GitHub Actions or other CI/CD configurations for the created projects.

7. Implement a feature to automatically run gofmt, goimports, and golint on the generated code.

8. Add an interactive mode that guides users through project creation with step-by-step prompts.

9. Implement a feature to generate API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI) for web projects.

10. Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for containerized applications.

These enhancements would make the program even more powerful and versatile for generating Go projects.
