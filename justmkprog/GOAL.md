## Project: mkprogmkprog

### Objective
Develop a meta-program that generates Go programs using AI, specifically designed to create a more advanced version of itself. The program should utilize the langchaingo library to interact with AI language models and produce complete, functional Go projects based on user input.

### Key Features
1. AI-powered code generation using the Anthropic API
2. Flexible input handling (file or stdin)
3. Customizable output directory
4. Verbose logging option
5. Adjustable AI temperature and max tokens
6. Streaming output for generated content
7. Multi-file project generation
8. Embedded system prompts
9. Debug mode for source code dumping

### Recent Progress
- Implemented iterative improvements based on AI suggestions
- Enhanced input handling and output generation capabilities
- Added support for different AI models and providers
- Implemented a more robust file writing system
- Added a dumpsrc() function for debugging purposes

### Next Steps
1. Implement goimports functionality for automatic code formatting
2. Add support for custom system prompts
3. Implement concurrent processing for improved efficiency
4. Add progress indicators or detailed status updates during generation
5. Implement a caching mechanism for AI responses
6. Add support for generating unit tests
7. Implement a dry-run mode for previewing generated content
8. Add functionality to update existing Go projects
9. Implement a plugin system for easy extensibility
10. Add support for generating different types of Go projects (e.g., CLI tools, web servers, libraries)

### Long-term Goals
1. Support multiple programming languages
2. Implement an interactive mode for step-by-step project creation
3. Integrate version control system initialization
4. Add containerization support (Dockerfile generation)
5. Implement advanced code analysis and optimization features

The project aims to create a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly tool for generating Go programs, with the ultimate goal of being able to improve and extend itself through AI-powered code generation.
