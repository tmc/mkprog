<comparison>
The new program (mkprog) is an improved and more focused version of the original program. Here's a comparison of the key aspects:

1. Purpose: Both programs generate Go code using AI, but the new program is specifically designed to create complete Go projects based on a program name and description.

2. Features:
   - Both use the langchaingo library and Anthropic's language model.
   - Both implement error handling, follow Go best practices, and include features like custom temperature settings and optional goimports execution.
   - The new program adds support for input from stdin or file, verbose logging, and a max-tokens flag.

3. Structure:
   - Both use a main() and run() pattern for error handling.
   - The new program has a more modular structure with separate functions for reading input and writing files.

4. Input handling:
   - The original program used command-line arguments directly.
   - The new program supports input from both command-line and file, with a default to stdin.

5. Output handling:
   - Both use streaming output for generated content.
   - The new program implements a more robust FileWriter struct for managing multiple output files.

6. Error handling:
   - Both implement comprehensive error handling.
   - The new program adds verbose logging options for better debugging.

7. Code generation:
   - Both use the Anthropic language model with similar settings.
   - The new program adds support for max tokens and uses GenerateContentStream for better control over the output.

8. Additional features:
   - The new program implements the dumpsrc() function for debugging purposes.
   - It also includes more flexible command-line flags for customization.

Overall, the new program is more specialized and feature-rich, while maintaining the core functionality of the original program.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Add support for multiple output formats (e.g., JSON, YAML) for the generated project structure.
2. Implement a progress bar or more detailed status updates during the generation process.
3. Add an option to generate unit tests for the created program.
4. Include a flag to specify the target Go version for the generated project.
5. Implement a caching mechanism for frequently used AI responses to improve performance.
6. Add support for generating documentation (e.g., godoc) for the created program.
7. Include an option to integrate with popular CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) by generating appropriate configuration files.
8. Implement a dry-run mode that shows what files would be generated without actually creating them.
9. Add support for custom templates or plugins to extend the program's functionality.
10. Implement a feature to analyze the generated code for potential improvements or best practices violations.
