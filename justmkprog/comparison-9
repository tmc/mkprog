The new program (mkprog-9) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Enhanced CLI interface: The new program uses the Cobra library for a more robust command-line interface, providing better flag handling and help documentation.

2. Configuration management: It incorporates Viper for configuration management, allowing users to set default values through a YAML configuration file.

3. Expanded AI model support: While the original program only supported Anthropic, the new version allows for selection between different AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere).

4. Project templates: The new program introduces the concept of project templates (CLI, web, library), allowing for more specialized code generation.

5. Dry-run option: A dry-run flag has been added to preview generated content without creating files.

6. Progress indicator: The new version includes a spinner to provide visual feedback during content generation.

7. Concurrent file writing: The new program implements concurrent file writing using goroutines for improved performance.

8. Modular structure: The code is more modular and better organized, with separate functions for different tasks.

9. Improved error handling: The new version has more comprehensive error handling and reporting.

10. Configuration file support: It adds support for configuration files, allowing users to set default values for flags.

11. Customization options: The new program offers more customization options, such as custom templates and project types.

While the original program was functional, the new version offers a more feature-rich, flexible, and user-friendly experience. It addresses many of the requested features from the prompt, such as configuration file support, progress indication, and concurrent file writing. However, some advanced features mentioned in the prompt (e.g., caching, plugin system, version control integration) are not yet implemented in this version.

To further improve the program, consider implementing the following features:

1. Caching system: Add a caching mechanism to store and reuse previously generated content.

2. Plugin system: Implement a plugin architecture to allow users to extend the program's functionality.

3. Interactive mode: Add an interactive mode for users to provide project details step-by-step.

4. Version control integration: Implement Git integration to initialize the project repository.

5. Containerization support: Add options to generate Dockerfiles and docker-compose files.

6. Code linting and formatting: Integrate gofmt and golint for automatic code formatting and linting.

7. Project documentation generation: Add support for generating project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

8. Existing project updates: Implement functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

9. More comprehensive testing: Add more unit tests to cover various scenarios and edge cases.

10. Advanced error handling: Implement more detailed error messages and logging for better debugging.

These additions would bring the program closer to the full set of features outlined in the original prompt and make it an even more powerful tool for Go project generation.
