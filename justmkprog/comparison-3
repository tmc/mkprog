The new program (mkprog-3) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Enhanced CLI interface: The new program uses the Cobra library for a more robust command-line interface, providing better flag handling and help documentation.

2. Configuration management: It implements a configuration file system using Viper, allowing users to set default values for flags in a YAML file.

3. Improved project structure generation: The new program generates a complete project structure based on user-provided descriptions and selected templates, including main.go, additional packages, test files, README.md, and go.mod.

4. AI model flexibility: While the original program was limited to Anthropic's API, the new version supports multiple AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere) with an option to select the desired model.

5. Project templates: The new program introduces project templates (CLI, web, library) for more tailored code generation.

6. Concurrent file writing: It implements concurrent file creation using goroutines and a WaitGroup for improved performance.

7. Progress indicator: A spinner is added to provide visual feedback during content generation.

8. Dry-run option: Users can preview generated content without creating files.

9. Structured output: The AI-generated content is parsed as JSON, allowing for better organization and manipulation of the generated project structure.

10. Error handling: The new program implements more comprehensive error handling and aggregation.

11. Code organization: The code is better organized with separate functions for different responsibilities, improving readability and maintainability.

These enhancements make the new program more flexible, user-friendly, and capable of generating more complex and varied Go project structures.

To further improve the program, consider implementing the following features:

1. Caching system: Add a caching mechanism to store and reuse previously generated content, reducing API calls and improving performance.

2. Project updating: Implement functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

3. Interactive mode: Add an interactive mode for users to provide project details step-by-step.

4. Version control integration: Implement Git integration to initialize the project repository automatically.

5. Containerization support: Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files.

6. Code linting and formatting: Implement a post-generation step using tools like gofmt and golint.

7. Documentation generation: Add an option to generate project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

8. Plugin system: Implement a plugin system to allow users to extend the program's functionality.

9. Test generation: Enhance the AI prompt to generate comprehensive unit tests for the created project.

10. Dependency management: Implement automatic dependency resolution and updating of the go.mod file.

These additions would make the program even more powerful and useful for developers looking to quickly bootstrap Go projects with AI-generated code.
