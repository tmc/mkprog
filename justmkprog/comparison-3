<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-3) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Enhanced CLI interface: The new program uses the Cobra library for a more robust command-line interface, providing better flag handling and help documentation.

2. Configuration management: It incorporates Viper for configuration management, allowing users to set default values in a config file.

3. Expanded functionality: The new program supports different project templates (CLI, web server, library) and AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere), making it more versatile.

4. Improved project structure generation: It generates a complete project structure with multiple files, including tests and documentation, as opposed to the original program's focus on a single main.go file.

5. Concurrent file writing: The new program implements concurrent file creation using goroutines, potentially improving performance for larger projects.

6. Progress indicator: It includes a spinner to show progress during content generation, enhancing user experience.

7. Dry-run option: Users can preview generated content without creating files, which is useful for testing and verification.

8. Caching system: The new program includes a basic caching system to store and reuse previously generated content, although it's not fully implemented in the provided code.

9. More comprehensive error handling: The new program has more robust error handling and logging throughout the codebase.

10. Structured output: The generated project structure is returned as a JSON object, allowing for easier parsing and manipulation.

11. Customization options: Users can provide custom templates and select different project types, making the tool more flexible.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, user-friendly, and adheres more closely to modern Go best practices and design patterns.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement the caching system fully to store and retrieve previously generated content efficiently.

2. Add support for updating existing projects based on new descriptions.

3. Implement custom template loading and parsing functionality.

4. Enhance error messages and logging to provide more detailed information for debugging.

5. Add unit tests for the main functions to ensure reliability and ease of maintenance.

6. Implement support for other AI models (OpenAI, Cohere) as mentioned in the flags.

7. Add a feature to generate and update Go package documentation (godoc) automatically.

8. Implement a plugin system to allow users to extend the functionality easily.

9. Add support for generating GitHub Actions or other CI/CD configurations based on the project type.

10. Implement a feature to analyze existing code and suggest improvements or refactorings using the AI model.

These enhancements would make the program even more powerful and useful for Go developers.
