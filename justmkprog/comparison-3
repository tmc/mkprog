<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-3) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Enhanced CLI: The new program uses the Cobra library for a more robust command-line interface, providing better flag handling and help documentation.

2. Configuration Management: It incorporates Viper for configuration management, allowing users to set default values in a YAML file.

3. Expanded Functionality: The new version supports multiple AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere), project templates, and custom template files.

4. Improved Error Handling: The new program has more comprehensive error handling and logging.

5. Concurrent File Writing: It implements concurrent file writing using goroutines for better performance.

6. Progress Indicator: A spinner is added to provide visual feedback during content generation.

7. Dry Run Option: Users can preview generated content without creating files.

8. Structured Project Generation: The new program parses the AI-generated content into a structured format before creating files.

9. Verbose Logging: A verbose flag is added for detailed logging during execution.

10. Code Organization: The new program is better organized with separate functions for different responsibilities.

11. Flexibility: The new version is more flexible and extensible, allowing for easier addition of new features in the future.

12. Documentation: The README.md file is more comprehensive, providing detailed usage instructions and examples.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, user-friendly, and adheres more closely to Go best practices and modern CLI application design principles.

To further improve the program, consider implementing the following features:

1. Add support for generating different types of Go projects (e.g., microservices, REST APIs, GraphQL servers).

2. Implement a caching system to store and reuse previously generated content for similar project requests.

3. Add functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

4. Implement a plugin system to allow users to extend the program's functionality easily.

5. Add an interactive mode for users to provide project details step-by-step.

6. Implement version control system integration (e.g., Git) to initialize the project repository.

7. Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for containerization.

8. Implement a code linting and formatting step using tools like gofmt and golint to ensure generated code follows best practices.

9. Add an option to generate project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

10. Implement dependency management functionality to manage and update project dependencies.

These additions would make the program even more powerful and versatile for generating Go projects.
