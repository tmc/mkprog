The new program (mkprog-5) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Enhanced CLI: The new program uses the Cobra library for a more robust command-line interface, providing better flag handling and help documentation.

2. Configuration Management: It incorporates Viper for configuration management, allowing users to set default values in a YAML file.

3. Multiple AI Models: While the original only supported Anthropic, the new version allows selection between different AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere).

4. Project Templates: The new program introduces the concept of project templates (CLI, web, library), making it more versatile.

5. Dry Run Option: A dry-run flag has been added to preview generated content without creating files.

6. Progress Indicator: The new version includes a spinner to show progress during content generation.

7. Concurrent File Writing: The new program implements concurrent file writing using goroutines for improved performance.

8. Structured Project Generation: The new version generates a more complete project structure, including test files and additional packages as needed.

9. Verbose Logging: A verbose flag has been added for detailed logging, which is useful for debugging.

10. Error Handling: The new program has more comprehensive error handling and reporting.

11. Code Organization: The new version has a cleaner, more modular code structure with separate functions for different tasks.

12. Documentation: The README for the new program is more comprehensive, including detailed usage instructions and configuration options.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, flexible, and user-friendly compared to the original version. It addresses many of the limitations of the original program and adds several new capabilities that make it a more powerful tool for generating Go projects.

To further improve the program, consider implementing the following features:

1. Caching System: Implement a caching mechanism to store and reuse previously generated content for similar project requests.

2. Project Updating: Add functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

3. Plugin System: Implement a plugin architecture to allow users to extend the program's functionality easily.

4. Interactive Mode: Add an interactive mode for users to provide project details step-by-step.

5. Version Control Integration: Implement Git integration to initialize the project repository automatically.

6. Containerization Support: Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files.

7. Code Linting and Formatting: Implement a post-generation step to run tools like gofmt and golint on the generated code.

8. Documentation Generation: Add an option to generate project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

9. Dependency Management: Implement functionality to manage and update project dependencies.

10. Performance Optimization: Profile the application and optimize resource usage, especially for large project generations.

These enhancements would make the program even more powerful and useful for a wider range of Go development scenarios.
