<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-5) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Enhanced CLI functionality:
   - Uses the Cobra library for a more robust command-line interface.
   - Implements more command-line flags, including AI model selection and project template.

2. Configuration management:
   - Utilizes the Viper library for configuration management.
   - Supports a configuration file (mkprog.yaml) for storing default values.

3. Improved project structure generation:
   - Generates a complete project structure based on the user's description.
   - Supports multiple AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere) instead of just Anthropic.
   - Implements custom project templates (CLI tool, web server, library).

4. Better error handling and logging:
   - More comprehensive error handling throughout the program.
   - Uses a channel to collect errors from concurrent operations.

5. Concurrent file writing:
   - Implements concurrent file writing using goroutines and a WaitGroup for improved performance.

6. Progress indication:
   - Adds a spinner to show progress during content generation.

7. Dry-run option:
   - Implements a dry-run flag to preview generated content without creating files.

8. Structured output:
   - Uses a ProjectStructure type to organize generated files and their contents.

9. JSON parsing:
   - Parses the AI-generated content as JSON, allowing for a more structured representation of the project.

10. More flexible and extensible:
    - The new design allows for easier addition of new features and project templates.

11. Better documentation:
    - Includes a more comprehensive README with detailed usage instructions and examples.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, flexible, and adheres better to Go best practices. It provides a more complete solution for generating Go project structures based on user descriptions.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement caching for generated content to improve performance and reduce API calls.
2. Add support for updating existing projects based on new descriptions.
3. Implement an interactive mode for step-by-step project creation.
4. Add version control system integration (e.g., Git) to initialize the project repository.
5. Implement support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files.
6. Add code linting and formatting using tools like gofmt and golint.
7. Implement a plugin system to allow users to extend the program's functionality.
8. Add support for generating project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.
9. Implement more comprehensive unit tests for the program.
10. Add support for different types of Go projects (e.g., microservices, REST APIs, GraphQL servers).

These enhancements would make the program even more powerful and versatile for generating Go project structures.
