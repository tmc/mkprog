<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-5) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Enhanced CLI: The new program uses the Cobra library for a more robust command-line interface, providing better flag handling and help documentation.

2. Configuration Management: It implements a configuration file system using Viper, allowing for default values to be stored and easily overridden.

3. AI Model Flexibility: The new program supports multiple AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere) instead of being limited to just Anthropic.

4. Project Templates: It introduces the concept of project templates (CLI, web, library), allowing for more specialized code generation.

5. Concurrent File Writing: The new program implements concurrent file writing using goroutines, which should improve performance for larger projects.

6. Progress Indicator: It adds a spinner to provide visual feedback during content generation.

7. Caching System: The new program implements a basic caching system to store and reuse previously generated content.

8. Dry Run Option: It adds a dry-run flag to preview generated content without creating files.

9. Structured Output: The AI-generated content is expected to be in a structured JSON format, which allows for easier parsing and handling of multiple files.

10. Error Handling: The new program has more comprehensive error handling and provides more informative error messages.

11. Code Organization: The code is better organized with separate functions for different responsibilities, improving readability and maintainability.

12. Logging: While not explicitly implemented in the provided code, there's mention of proper logging for debugging and monitoring.

13. Flexibility: The new program is designed to be more flexible and extensible, capable of handling various project types and AI models.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, better structured, and more aligned with modern Go development practices compared to the original program.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement the logging functionality mentioned in the requirements, using a library like logrus or zap for structured logging.

2. Add unit tests as mentioned in the requirements. This will improve the reliability and maintainability of the code.

3. Implement the functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions, as mentioned in the original requirements.

4. Enhance the caching system to persist cache between runs, possibly using a local database or file-based storage.

5. Implement custom template handling as mentioned in the requirements. This could involve reading and parsing template files.

6. Add more robust error handling for API calls and file operations, possibly implementing retry logic for transient errors.

7. Implement input validation for user-provided values, especially for the project description and output directory.

8. Consider adding a feature to generate and include license files based on user preference.

9. Implement a plugin system to allow users to extend the functionality of the program easily.

10. Add support for generating GitHub Actions or other CI/CD configurations as part of the project structure.

These enhancements would make the program even more powerful and flexible, fully meeting and exceeding the original requirements.
