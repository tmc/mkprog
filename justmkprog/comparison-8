The new program (mkprog-8) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Expanded functionality: The new program offers a more comprehensive set of features, including support for different project templates, AI model selection, and a dry-run option.

2. Improved CLI: The new version uses the cobra library for a more robust command-line interface, providing better help messages and flag handling.

3. Configuration file support: The new program implements configuration file support using viper, allowing users to set default values for flags.

4. Progress indicator: A spinner has been added to provide visual feedback during project generation.

5. Concurrent file generation: The new program uses goroutines to generate file content concurrently, potentially improving performance for larger projects.

6. Better error handling: The new version includes more comprehensive error handling and reporting throughout the code.

7. Modular design: The code is better organized into separate functions for different tasks, improving readability and maintainability.

8. Enhanced project structure generation: The new program generates a complete project structure based on the description and project type, rather than just individual files.

9. Flexibility: The new version allows for custom templates and different project types (CLI, web, library), making it more versatile.

10. Improved documentation: The README.md file for the new program is more comprehensive, providing detailed usage instructions and examples.

11. Better dependency management: The go.mod file in the new version includes more dependencies to support the expanded functionality.

12. Customizable AI parameters: The new program allows users to set max tokens and temperature for AI generation.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, flexible, and user-friendly compared to the original version. It addresses many of the limitations of the original program and provides a more complete solution for generating Go projects based on descriptions.

To further improve the program, consider implementing the following features:

1. Add support for more AI models, such as OpenAI and Cohere, as mentioned in the project description.

2. Implement a caching system to store and reuse previously generated content, improving performance for similar project requests.

3. Add functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

4. Implement a plugin system to allow users to extend the program's functionality easily.

5. Add an interactive mode for users to provide project details step-by-step.

6. Implement version control system integration (e.g., Git) to initialize the project repository.

7. Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for containerization.

8. Implement a code linting and formatting step using tools like gofmt and golint to ensure generated code follows best practices.

9. Add an option to generate project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

10. Implement dependency management functionality to manage and update project dependencies.

11. Profile the application and optimize resource usage, especially for large project generations.

These additions would make the program even more powerful and versatile, addressing all the requirements mentioned in the original project description.
