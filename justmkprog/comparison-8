The new program (mkprog) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Focused purpose: The new program is specifically designed to generate Go projects based on user input, while the original program was more general-purpose.

2. Enhanced command-line interface:
   - Added a `-max-tokens` flag to control the maximum number of tokens for AI generation.
   - Improved input handling with the `-f` flag for file input, defaulting to stdin.
   - Added an `-o` flag to specify the output directory for generated files.

3. Improved error handling and logging:
   - More comprehensive error messages and better error propagation.
   - Verbose logging option with the `-verbose` flag.

4. Streamlined content generation:
   - Uses a single GenerateContent call with streaming output, simplifying the code.
   - Removed the custom fileWriter struct, replacing it with a more straightforward writeFiles function.

5. Better project structure:
   - Clearer separation of concerns with distinct functions for different tasks (e.g., readInput, writeFiles, runGoimportsOnDir).
   - Improved organization of the main run() function.

6. Additional features:
   - Implemented the dumpsrc() function for debugging purposes.
   - Added support for running goimports on generated Go files.

7. Improved documentation:
   - More detailed README.md with clear usage instructions and examples.
   - Better inline comments explaining the code's functionality.

8. Simplified dependencies:
   - Removed unused imports and simplified the import section.

Overall, the new program is more focused, feature-rich, and better structured than the original. It provides a more user-friendly experience for generating Go projects and adheres more closely to Go best practices.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Add support for custom templates: Allow users to provide their own system prompt or template files for generating different types of projects.

2. Implement concurrent file writing: Use goroutines to write multiple files simultaneously, potentially improving performance for larger projects.

3. Add a validation step: Implement a function to validate the generated Go code before writing it to files, ensuring it compiles without errors.

4. Enhance error reporting: Provide more detailed error messages and suggestions when content generation or file writing fails.

5. Implement a progress indicator: Add a progress bar or spinner to show the status of content generation and file writing, especially useful for larger projects.

6. Add support for generating test files: Automatically create test files for the generated Go code.

7. Implement a dry-run mode: Allow users to preview the generated content without writing files to disk.

8. Add support for different AI models: Allow users to choose between different language models or providers (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) in addition to Anthropic.

9. Implement a caching mechanism: Cache frequently used prompts or generated content to improve performance for similar requests.

10. Add a cleanup function: Implement a function to remove partially generated files in case of errors during the generation process.

These suggestions aim to make the program more versatile, efficient, and user-friendly while maintaining its core functionality and adherence to Go best practices.
