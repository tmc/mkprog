<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-8) is a significant improvement over the original program. It implements many of the requested features and provides a more comprehensive and flexible solution for generating Go projects. Here's a comparison of the key aspects:

1. Command-line interface:
   - The new program uses the Cobra library for a more robust CLI implementation, providing better flag handling and help documentation.
   - It includes more flags as requested, such as project type, interactive mode, Git initialization, and Docker file generation.

2. Configuration:
   - The new program implements a configuration file system using Viper, allowing users to store default values for flags.

3. AI integration:
   - Both programs use the Anthropic API, but the new one is more flexible, allowing for potential integration with other AI models (although not fully implemented).

4. Project structure generation:
   - The new program generates a more complete project structure, including additional packages, test files, and documentation.

5. Concurrent file writing:
   - The new program implements concurrent file writing using goroutines, improving performance for larger projects.

6. Progress indication:
   - A spinner is added to provide visual feedback during content generation.

7. Interactive mode:
   - The new program includes an interactive mode for step-by-step project configuration.

8. Dry-run option:
   - A dry-run flag is implemented to preview generated content without creating files.

9. Version control integration:
   - The new program can initialize a Git repository for the generated project.

10. Docker support:
    - Functionality to generate Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files is added.

11. Error handling and logging:
    - The new program implements more comprehensive error handling and logging.

12. Code organization:
    - The new program is better organized, with separate functions for different features, improving maintainability.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, flexible, and user-friendly compared to the original. It addresses most of the requested functionality and provides a solid foundation for further improvements and extensions.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider implementing the following features:

1. Caching system: Add a caching mechanism to store and reuse previously generated content, improving performance for similar project requests.

2. Project updating: Implement functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

3. Plugin system: Create a plugin architecture to allow users to extend the program's functionality easily.

4. Code linting and formatting: Integrate tools like gofmt and golint to ensure generated code follows best practices.

5. Project documentation generation: Add support for generating project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

6. Expanded AI model support: Fully implement support for multiple AI models (OpenAI, Cohere) as alternatives to Anthropic.

7. Template management: Implement a system for managing and selecting from multiple project templates.

8. Dependency management: Add functionality to manage and update project dependencies.

9. Testing improvements: Expand the test suite to cover more scenarios and edge cases.

10. Performance optimization: Profile the application and optimize resource usage, especially for large project generations.

These additions would make the program even more powerful and versatile for generating Go projects.
