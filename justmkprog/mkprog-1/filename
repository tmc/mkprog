Ensure all imports are used and all types are correctly referenced from the langchaingo library. The import section should look similar to this (note the underscore import for embed):

    import (
        "context"
        _ "embed"
        "fmt"
        // other necessary imports
        "github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms"
        "github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/anthropic"
    )

The generated program should be fully functional, well-structured, and adhere to Go best practices. It should be ready to run without any additional modifications or formatting changes.

Follow unix philosophy and do not output more than necessary.
