<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-2) is a significant improvement over the original mkprog. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Expanded functionality: The new program offers a wider range of features, including support for different project templates, dry-run option, and AI model selection.

2. Improved command-line interface: The new version uses the cobra library for a more robust CLI, with better flag handling and subcommand support.

3. Configuration file support: The new program uses viper to handle configuration files, allowing users to set default values for flags.

4. Enhanced project generation: The new version generates a more complete project structure, including additional packages, test files, and documentation.

5. Concurrent file writing: The new program implements concurrent file creation using goroutines for improved performance.

6. Progress indicator: A spinner is added to provide visual feedback during content generation.

7. Better error handling: The new version includes more comprehensive error handling and reporting.

8. Modular design: The code is better organized with separate functions for different tasks, improving maintainability.

9. Extensibility: The new program is designed with future extensions in mind, including placeholders for features like caching, plugins, and version control integration.

10. Improved documentation: The README.md file is more comprehensive, providing better installation and usage instructions.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, user-friendly, and adheres more closely to Go best practices and modern application design principles.

To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement the JSON parsing functionality for the AI response in the generateProjectStructure function.

2. Add support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Cohere) as mentioned in the flags.

3. Implement the custom template support feature.

4. Add the caching system for generated content to improve performance and reduce API calls.

5. Implement the interactive mode for step-by-step project creation.

6. Add version control integration (e.g., Git) for initializing the project repository.

7. Implement Docker support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files.

8. Add code linting and formatting using gofmt and golint.

9. Implement project documentation generation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

10. Develop a plugin system to allow users to extend the program's functionality.

11. Add more comprehensive unit tests for the program.

12. Implement the project updating functionality to modify existing projects based on new descriptions.

These enhancements will make the program even more powerful and versatile, catering to a wider range of use cases and user preferences.
