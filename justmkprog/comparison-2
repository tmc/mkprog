<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-2) is a significant improvement over the original mkprog. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Enhanced CLI interface: The new program uses the Cobra library for a more robust and feature-rich command-line interface, making it easier to add and manage command-line flags.

2. Configuration file support: The new version implements configuration file support using Viper, allowing users to set default values for flags in a YAML file.

3. Improved project structure generation: The new program generates a more comprehensive project structure, including additional package files and test files, which were not present in the original version.

4. Concurrent file writing: The new version implements concurrent file writing using goroutines, which can improve performance when generating multiple files.

5. Progress indicator: A spinner has been added to provide visual feedback during content generation, enhancing the user experience.

6. Dry-run option: The new program includes a dry-run flag to preview generated content without creating files, which was not available in the original version.

7. Flexible AI model selection: The new version allows users to choose between different AI models (although only Anthropic is currently implemented), providing more flexibility for future expansions.

8. Project templates: The new program supports different project templates (CLI, web, library), allowing for more specialized code generation based on project type.

9. Improved error handling and logging: The new version implements more comprehensive error handling and uses the log package for better error reporting.

10. Code organization: The new program has a clearer separation of concerns, with distinct functions for generating project structure and creating project files.

11. Dependency management: The go.mod file in the new version includes additional dependencies required for the enhanced functionality.

12. Dumpsrc function: The new version includes a dumpsrc() function for debugging purposes, triggered by an environment variable.

Overall, the new program offers a more feature-rich, flexible, and user-friendly experience for generating Go projects based on descriptions. It addresses many limitations of the original version and provides a solid foundation for further enhancements and extensions.

To further improve the program, consider implementing the following features:

1. Add support for other AI models (OpenAI, Cohere) as mentioned in the project description.

2. Implement the caching system to store and reuse previously generated content.

3. Add functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

4. Implement the plugin system for easy extensibility.

5. Add an interactive mode for step-by-step project detail input.

6. Implement version control system integration (e.g., Git) for repository initialization.

7. Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files.

8. Implement code linting and formatting using tools like gofmt and golint.

9. Add an option to generate project documentation using GoDoc or pkgsite.

10. Implement dependency management functionality for managing project dependencies.

11. Profile the application and optimize resource usage for large project generations.

These additions would bring the program closer to the full set of features described in the project prompt and make it an even more powerful tool for Go project generation.
