<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-2) is an improved and more focused version of the original mkprog. Here's a comparison of the key differences and improvements:

1. Input Handling:
   - Original: Accepts command-line arguments directly.
   - New: Uses a file input flag (-f) that defaults to stdin, allowing for more flexible input methods.

2. Output Directory:
   - Original: Uses the first command-line argument as the output directory.
   - New: Requires an explicit output directory flag (-o), making it clearer and more flexible.

3. Temperature and Max Tokens:
   - Original: Only has a temperature flag.
   - New: Implements both temperature and max-tokens flags, providing more control over AI generation.

4. Verbose Logging:
   - Original: No verbose logging option.
   - New: Adds a verbose flag for detailed logging, improving debugging and user feedback.

5. Goimports:
   - Original: Automatically runs goimports if available.
   - New: Makes goimports execution optional with a flag, giving users more control.

6. Error Handling:
   - Original: Uses a custom error handling approach.
   - New: Simplifies error handling by using log.Fatal in main() and returning errors from run().

7. File Writing:
   - Original: Uses a custom fileWriter struct with streaming.
   - New: Implements a simpler writeFiles function that processes the entire content at once.

8. README:
   - Original: More general-purpose description.
   - New: More specific to the generated program's functionality and usage.

9. Code Structure:
   - Original: Includes more complex file handling and regex-based content processing.
   - New: Streamlined and focused on the core functionality of generating content and writing files.

10. Dumpsrc Function:
    - Original: Includes a dumpsrc() function for debugging.
    - New: Omits this function, focusing on core functionality.

Overall, the new program is more focused on the specific task of generating Go projects based on user input. It offers improved flexibility in input handling, more control over AI generation parameters, and a cleaner, more streamlined codebase. The new version also provides better documentation and usage instructions in its README.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement concurrent file writing for larger projects to improve performance.
2. Add support for custom templates or project structures that users can define.
3. Implement a progress bar or more detailed streaming output to provide better feedback during content generation.
4. Add an option to generate unit tests for the created project.
5. Implement a feature to automatically initialize a git repository for the generated project.
6. Add support for different AI models or providers, allowing users to choose their preferred backend.
7. Implement a caching mechanism for frequently generated content to improve response times.
8. Add a feature to validate the generated code syntax before writing to files.
9. Implement a dry-run mode that shows what would be generated without actually creating files.
10. Add support for generating documentation comments in the code based on the project description.

These suggestions aim to enhance the functionality, flexibility, and user experience of the mkprog tool.
