<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-2) is a significant improvement over the original mkprog. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Enhanced CLI interface:
   - Uses the Cobra library for a more robust command-line interface.
   - Implements more command-line flags for greater flexibility.

2. Configuration management:
   - Utilizes Viper for configuration management, supporting YAML config files and environment variables.

3. Project structure generation:
   - Generates a complete project structure based on user-provided descriptions and templates.
   - Supports different project types (CLI, web, library).

4. Concurrent file writing:
   - Implements goroutines for concurrent file writing, improving performance.

5. Progress indication:
   - Uses a spinner to show progress during project generation.

6. Dry-run option:
   - Allows users to preview generated content without creating files.

7. Modular design:
   - Separates concerns into different functions for better maintainability.

8. Error handling:
   - Implements more comprehensive error handling and reporting.

9. Caching:
   - Includes a basic caching system (though not fully implemented in the provided code).

10. Customization:
    - Supports custom templates and different AI models.

11. Code structure:
    - More organized and modular code structure, following Go best practices.

12. Documentation:
    - Provides a more comprehensive README with detailed usage instructions and configuration options.

Overall, the new program offers more features, better flexibility, and improved code organization compared to the original mkprog.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement the caching system fully to store and reuse previously generated content.
2. Add unit tests for the main functionality of the program.
3. Implement the functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.
4. Add support for custom project templates, allowing users to define their own project structures.
5. Implement more robust error handling and logging throughout the program.
6. Add support for multiple AI models (OpenAI, Cohere) as mentioned in the flags but not implemented in the code.
7. Implement a progress bar for more detailed progress tracking during project generation.
8. Add validation for user inputs and configuration values.
9. Implement a feature to generate and update documentation for existing projects.
10. Consider adding a feature to analyze and suggest improvements for existing Go projects.

These enhancements would make the program even more powerful and user-friendly while maintaining its core functionality of generating Go project structures based on descriptions.
