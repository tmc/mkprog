<comparison>
The new program (mkprog) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Focused purpose: The new program is specifically designed to generate Go projects based on user input, while the original program had a more general purpose.

2. Enhanced command-line interface:
   - Added more flags for customization (-temperature, -max-tokens, -verbose, -f, -o, -goimports)
   - Improved usage instructions and error handling

3. Input flexibility: The new program can read input from stdin or a file, making it more versatile.

4. Structured output: The generated content is properly separated into different files (main.go, go.mod, README.md, etc.) with appropriate headers.

5. Streaming output: Implemented streaming functionality for real-time output of generated content.

6. File writing: Added a dedicated function (writeFiles) to handle the creation of multiple files based on the generated content.

7. Goimports integration: Optional execution of goimports on generated Go files.

8. Verbose logging: Added a verbose flag for detailed logging during execution.

9. Improved error handling: More comprehensive error checking and reporting throughout the program.

10. Better code organization: The new program has a clearer structure with well-defined functions for different tasks.

11. Updated README: The README.md file provides more detailed information about the program's features, installation, and usage.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, user-friendly, and adheres more closely to the specified requirements and best practices for Go programming.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Add support for custom templates: Allow users to provide their own system prompt or templates for generated files.

2. Implement concurrent file writing: Use goroutines to write multiple files simultaneously for improved performance.

3. Add a dry-run option: Allow users to preview the generated content without actually creating files.

4. Implement a progress indicator: Show a progress bar or spinner during content generation for better user experience.

5. Add support for different AI models: Allow users to choose between different language models (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) in addition to Anthropic.

6. Implement caching: Store previously generated content to speed up repeated requests.

7. Add unit tests: Implement comprehensive unit tests to ensure program reliability and ease future maintenance.

8. Support for project templates: Allow users to specify a project template (e.g., CLI tool, web server, library) to guide the generation process.

9. Implement a config file: Allow users to set default values for flags in a configuration file.

10. Add a feature to update existing projects: Implement functionality to modify or extend existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

These enhancements would make the program even more powerful and flexible for generating Go projects.
