<comparison>
The new program, mkprog, is a significant improvement and expansion upon the original program. Here's a comparison of the key features and changes:

1. Functionality:
   - Original: Focused on generating a single Go program.
   - New: Generates a complete Go project structure with multiple files and packages.

2. AI Model Integration:
   - Original: Used only Anthropic's API.
   - New: Supports multiple AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere) with easy selection.

3. Command-line Interface:
   - Original: Basic flag parsing.
   - New: Uses Cobra for a more robust and feature-rich CLI.

4. Configuration:
   - Original: Limited configuration options.
   - New: Implements a configuration file system using Viper for flexible defaults.

5. Project Templates:
   - Original: No template system.
   - New: Supports different project types (CLI, web, library) and custom templates.

6. Performance:
   - Original: Sequential file writing.
   - New: Implements concurrent file writing for improved performance.

7. User Experience:
   - Original: Basic output.
   - New: Adds a progress indicator (spinner) during content generation.

8. Preview Feature:
   - Original: No preview option.
   - New: Implements a dry-run option to preview generated content.

9. Error Handling:
   - Original: Basic error handling.
   - New: More comprehensive error handling and informative error messages.

10. Code Structure:
    - Original: Single file implementation.
    - New: Better structured with separate functions for different responsibilities.

11. Dependencies:
    - Original: Minimal external dependencies.
    - New: Utilizes additional libraries for enhanced functionality (Cobra, Viper, spinner).

12. Documentation:
    - Original: Basic README.
    - New: More comprehensive README with detailed usage instructions and examples.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, flexible, and user-friendly. It provides a more complete solution for generating Go projects, with better performance and extensibility.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the mkprog program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement the caching system mentioned in the prompt to store and reuse previously generated content.

2. Add comprehensive unit tests for the program, as specified in the prompt.

3. Implement the functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

4. Enhance the error handling to provide more specific and actionable error messages.

5. Add more detailed logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.

6. Implement support for custom templates, as mentioned in the prompt.

7. Consider adding a feature to validate the generated project structure and code.

8. Implement a plugin system to allow users to extend the functionality of mkprog.

9. Add support for generating documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkg.go.dev.

10. Implement a feature to automatically run tests and linters on the generated code.

11. Consider adding support for generating Dockerfiles and CI/CD configurations for the projects.

12. Implement a feature to suggest improvements or best practices for the generated code.

These suggestions would help make mkprog an even more powerful and versatile tool for generating Go projects.
