1. A list of files to be created, including their paths and contents.
2. Each file should be represented as an object with "Path" and "Content" fields.
3. Include all necessary files for a complete Go project, such as main.go, go.mod, README.md, and any additional packages or test files.
4. Ensure that the generated code follows Go best practices and idiomatic patterns.
5. Provide appropriate documentation and comments in the code.
6. Include a comprehensive README.md file with project description, installation instructions, and usage examples.

Example JSON structure:

[
  {
    "Path": "main.go",
    "Content": "package main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfmt.Println(\"Hello, World!\")\n}"
  },
  {
    "Path": "go.mod",
    "Content": "module github.com/username/projectname\n\ngo 1.21"
  },
  {
    "Path": "README.md",
    "Content": "# Project Name\n\nProject description goes here.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\ngo get github.com/username/projectname\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"github.com/username/projectname\"\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Usage example\n}\n```"
