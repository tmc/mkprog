## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity and Flexibility**: The program should be easy to use while offering flexibility through command-line flags and configuration options.

2. **AI-Powered Code Generation**: Utilize AI language models to generate complete, functional Go programs based on user input.

3. **Best Practices**: Adhere to Go best practices and idiomatic patterns in both the main program and generated code.

4. **Modularity**: Implement a modular design that allows for easy extension and maintenance.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and provide informative error messages to users.

6. **Documentation**: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation, including usage instructions and examples.

7. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly iterate and improve the program based on user feedback and new ideas.

## Design Principles

1. **Unix Philosophy**: Follow the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well and composing simple tools to build more complex systems.

2. **Configurability**: Allow users to customize the program's behavior through command-line flags and potentially configuration files.

3. **Extensibility**: Design the program to be easily extensible, potentially through a plugin system or well-defined interfaces.

4. **Performance**: Optimize for performance where possible, including concurrent processing for file operations.

5. **User Experience**: Provide a smooth user experience with clear output, progress indicators, and helpful error messages.

## Development Principles

1. **Iterative Development**: Use an iterative approach to continuously improve and refine the program.

2. **Version Control**: Maintain a clear and descriptive git history to track changes and improvements.

3. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability and catch regressions.

4. **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality through consistent formatting, linting, and code reviews.

5. **Open Source**: Embrace open-source principles, including clear licensing and contribution guidelines.

## Feature Principles

1. **AI Model Flexibility**: Support multiple AI models and providers to give users choice and flexibility.

2. **Project Templates**: Implement a system for managing and selecting from multiple project templates.

3. **Code Generation**: Generate not just main code, but also tests, documentation, and supporting files.

4. **Interactivity**: Provide both non-interactive and interactive modes for different use cases.

5. **Integration**: Support integration with common development tools and workflows, such as version control systems and containerization.

By adhering to these principles, we aim to create a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly tool for generating Go programs using AI, while maintaining a high standard of code quality and user experience.
