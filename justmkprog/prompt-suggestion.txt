To further improve the program, consider implementing the following features:

1. Caching system: Add a caching mechanism to store and reuse previously generated content, improving performance for similar project requests.

2. Project updating: Implement functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

3. Plugin system: Create a plugin architecture to allow users to extend the program's functionality easily.

4. Code linting and formatting: Integrate tools like gofmt and golint to ensure generated code follows best practices.

5. Project documentation generation: Add support for generating project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

6. Expanded AI model support: Fully implement support for multiple AI models (OpenAI, Cohere) as alternatives to Anthropic.

7. Template management: Implement a system for managing and selecting from multiple project templates.

8. Dependency management: Add functionality to manage and update project dependencies.

9. Testing improvements: Expand the test suite to cover more scenarios and edge cases.

10. Performance optimization: Profile the application and optimize resource usage, especially for large project generations.

These additions would make the program even more powerful and versatile for generating Go projects.
