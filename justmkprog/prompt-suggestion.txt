To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Add support for custom templates: Allow users to provide their own system prompt or templates for generated files.

2. Implement concurrent file writing: Use goroutines to write multiple files simultaneously for improved performance.

3. Add a dry-run option: Allow users to preview the generated content without actually creating files.

4. Implement a progress indicator: Show a progress bar or spinner during content generation for better user experience.

5. Add support for different AI models: Allow users to choose between different language models (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) in addition to Anthropic.

6. Implement caching: Store previously generated content to speed up repeated requests.

7. Add unit tests: Implement comprehensive unit tests to ensure program reliability and ease future maintenance.

8. Support for project templates: Allow users to specify a project template (e.g., CLI tool, web server, library) to guide the generation process.

9. Implement a config file: Allow users to set default values for flags in a configuration file.

10. Add a feature to update existing projects: Implement functionality to modify or extend existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

These enhancements would make the program even more powerful and flexible for generating Go projects.
