To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement the caching system mentioned in the prompt to store and reuse previously generated content.

2. Add support for updating existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

3. Implement the plugin system to allow users to extend the program's functionality.

4. Add an interactive mode for step-by-step project detail input.

5. Implement version control system integration (e.g., Git) to initialize the project repository.

6. Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files.

7. Implement code linting and formatting using tools like gofmt and golint.

8. Add an option to generate project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

9. Implement dependency management functionality.

10. Profile the application and optimize resource usage for large project generations.

11. Expand the test coverage to include more scenarios and edge cases.

12. Implement support for generating different types of Go projects (e.g., microservices, REST APIs, GraphQL servers).

These additions would make the program even more powerful and versatile, addressing all the points mentioned in the original prompt.
