<comparison>
The new program (mkprog) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Focused purpose: The new program is specifically designed to generate Go projects based on user input, while the original program had a more general purpose.

2. Improved command-line interface:
   - Added more flags for customization (-max-tokens, -verbose, -f, -o, -goimports)
   - Better usage instructions and examples in the README

3. Enhanced error handling and logging:
   - Implemented verbose logging option
   - More detailed error messages

4. File handling:
   - Improved file writing logic with separate functions
   - Support for running goimports on generated Go files

5. Input handling:
   - Added support for reading input from a file or stdin

6. Code structure:
   - More modular design with separate functions for different tasks
   - Cleaner main() and run() functions

7. Documentation:
   - More detailed README with clear installation and usage instructions
   - Better in-code comments

8. Anthropic model usage:
   - Explicitly uses the Anthropic model with appropriate options

9. Project generation:
   - Generates a complete project structure including main.go, go.mod, README.md, and other files

10. Removed unnecessary features:
    - Stripped out the streaming implementation, which wasn't necessary for this use case

Overall, the new program is more focused, feature-rich, and user-friendly compared to the original program. It better adheres to the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well and provides a more streamlined experience for generating Go projects based on user input.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Add a template system: Implement a way to use custom templates for generating different types of Go projects (e.g., CLI tools, web servers, libraries).

2. Implement caching: Add a caching mechanism for AI-generated content to improve performance and reduce API calls for similar requests.

3. Enhance error handling: Implement more granular error types and provide more informative error messages to the user.

4. Add unit tests: Include a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure the program's reliability and make it easier to maintain.

5. Implement a dry-run option: Add a flag that allows users to preview the files that would be generated without actually creating them.

6. Support for multiple AI models: Allow users to choose between different AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) for content generation.

7. Add a configuration file: Implement support for a configuration file to allow users to set default values for flags and other settings.

8. Implement project validation: Add a feature to validate the generated project structure and ensure all necessary files are present.

9. Add support for custom license types: Allow users to specify different license types for the generated projects.

10. Implement a progress indicator: Add a progress bar or spinner to provide visual feedback during the generation process.

These enhancements would make the program even more versatile and user-friendly while maintaining its core functionality.
