The new program (mkprog-4) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Enhanced CLI: The new program uses the Cobra library for a more robust command-line interface, providing better flag handling and help documentation.

2. Configuration Management: It incorporates Viper for configuration management, allowing users to set options via config files, environment variables, and command-line flags.

3. Expanded AI Model Support: While the original only supported Anthropic, the new version includes options for multiple AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere).

4. Project Templates: The new program introduces the concept of project templates (CLI, web, library), allowing for more specialized code generation.

5. Dry Run Option: A dry-run flag has been added to preview generated content without creating files.

6. Concurrent File Writing: The new version implements concurrent file writing using goroutines for improved performance.

7. Progress Indicator: A spinner has been added to provide visual feedback during content generation.

8. Structured Config: The program now uses a dedicated Config struct to manage configuration options.

9. Improved Error Handling: Error handling has been enhanced throughout the program.

10. More Flexible: The new version is more adaptable to different project types and user needs.

11. Better Code Organization: The code is better structured with clear separation of concerns.

While the original program was functional, the new version offers a more comprehensive, flexible, and user-friendly solution for generating Go projects.

To further improve the program, consider implementing the following features:

1. Caching System: Add a caching mechanism to store and reuse previously generated content, improving efficiency for similar project requests.

2. Project Updating: Implement functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions, allowing for iterative development.

3. Plugin System: Create a plugin architecture to allow users to extend the program's functionality with custom templates or generation logic.

4. Interactive Mode: Add an interactive mode where users can provide project details step-by-step through a series of prompts.

5. Version Control Integration: Implement automatic Git repository initialization and initial commit for generated projects.

6. Containerization Support: Add options to generate Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for easy containerization of the generated projects.

7. Code Quality Tools: Integrate code linting and formatting tools like gofmt and golint to ensure the generated code adheres to Go best practices.

8. Documentation Generation: Implement automatic generation of project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

9. Test Coverage: Expand the test suite to cover more edge cases and increase overall test coverage.

10. Telemetry: Add optional anonymous usage statistics to help improve the tool over time.

These additions would make the program even more powerful and useful for a wider range of Go development scenarios.
