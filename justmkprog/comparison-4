<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-4) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Expanded functionality: The new program offers more features, including custom templates, dry-run option, AI model selection, and project template selection.

2. Improved command-line interface: Uses the Cobra library for a more robust CLI with better flag handling and subcommands support.

3. Configuration management: Implements Viper for configuration file support and environment variable handling.

4. Concurrent processing: Utilizes goroutines for concurrent file writing, improving performance.

5. Caching system: Implements a caching mechanism to store and reuse previously generated content.

6. Progress indicator: Adds a spinner to show progress during content generation.

7. Structured output: Generates project structure as a JSON array of file contents, allowing for easier parsing and manipulation.

8. Modular design: The new program is more modular and easier to extend with additional features.

9. Better error handling: Implements more comprehensive error handling and reporting.

10. Improved documentation: The README.md file is more detailed and provides better usage instructions.

11. Dependency management: The go.mod file includes additional dependencies required for the enhanced functionality.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, user-friendly, and adheres better to Go best practices and modern CLI application design principles.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement unit tests for the main functions to ensure code reliability and ease of maintenance.

2. Add support for different output formats (e.g., JSON, YAML) for the generated project structure.

3. Implement a plugin system to allow users to extend the functionality with custom generators or templates.

4. Add a feature to validate the generated project structure and ensure all necessary files are created.

5. Implement a command to update existing projects based on new descriptions or requirements.

6. Add support for generating documentation in various formats (e.g., Markdown, AsciiDoc) for the created project.

7. Implement a feature to analyze the generated code for potential issues or improvements using static analysis tools.

8. Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for containerization of the created projects.

9. Implement a feature to generate GitHub Actions or other CI/CD configuration files for the created projects.

10. Add support for generating API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI) for web projects.

These suggestions would further enhance the functionality and usefulness of the mkprog tool, making it an even more powerful solution for generating Go projects.
