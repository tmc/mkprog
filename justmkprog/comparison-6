<comparison>
The new program represents a significant improvement and expansion over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Expanded Functionality:
   - The new program supports multiple AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere) instead of just Anthropic.
   - It introduces custom project templates (CLI tool, web server, library).
   - A dry-run option has been added for previewing generated content.
   - Concurrent file writing has been implemented for improved performance.
   - A progress indicator (spinner) has been added during content generation.

2. Improved Configuration:
   - The new program uses Viper for configuration management, supporting both YAML config files and environment variables.
   - It looks for configuration files in multiple locations ($HOME/.config/mkprog and current directory).

3. Enhanced CLI:
   - The new program uses Cobra for a more robust command-line interface.
   - It provides more command-line flags for greater customization.

4. Better Project Structure:
   - The new program generates a more comprehensive project structure, including additional packages and test files.

5. Improved Error Handling and Logging:
   - The new program implements more thorough error handling and verbose logging options.

6. Code Organization:
   - The new program's code is better organized with separate functions for different responsibilities (e.g., generateProjectStructure, createProjectFiles).

7. Documentation:
   - The README for the new program is more comprehensive, including detailed usage instructions and configuration options.

8. Flexibility:
   - The new program is more flexible and extensible, allowing for easier addition of new features in the future.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, robust, and user-friendly compared to the original version. It addresses many of the limitations of the original program and provides a more complete solution for generating Go projects based on user descriptions.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement the caching system mentioned in the prompt to store and reuse previously generated content.

2. Add comprehensive unit tests as specified in the prompt.

3. Implement the functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

4. Add support for generating different types of Go projects (e.g., microservices, REST APIs, GraphQL servers).

5. Implement the plugin system to allow users to extend the program's functionality easily.

6. Add an interactive mode for users to provide project details step-by-step.

7. Implement version control system integration (e.g., Git) to initialize the project repository.

8. Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for containerization.

9. Implement a code linting and formatting step using tools like gofmt and golint.

10. Add an option to generate project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

11. Implement dependency management functionality to manage and update project dependencies.

12. Profile the application and optimize resource usage, especially for large project generations.

These additions would make the program even more powerful and versatile, fully realizing the vision outlined in the prompt.
