<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-6) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Expanded functionality: The new program offers a more comprehensive set of features, including support for different project types, interactive mode, and dry-run capabilities.

2. Improved command-line interface: The new program uses the Cobra library for a more robust and user-friendly CLI, with better flag handling and subcommand support.

3. Configuration management: The new program incorporates Viper for configuration management, allowing users to set defaults via config files and environment variables.

4. Enhanced project generation: The new program generates a more complete project structure, including test files, documentation, and potentially Dockerfiles and CI/CD configurations.

5. Concurrent file writing: The new program implements concurrent file creation for improved performance.

6. Progress indication: A spinner is added to provide visual feedback during project generation.

7. Interactive mode: The new program includes an interactive mode for step-by-step project configuration.

8. Improved error handling and logging: The new program has more comprehensive error handling and verbose logging options.

9. Flexibility in AI model selection: While the original program was hardcoded to use Anthropic, the new program allows users to choose between different AI models.

10. Code organization: The new program has a cleaner code structure with better separation of concerns.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, flexible, and user-friendly compared to the original version. It addresses many of the limitations of the original program and provides a more comprehensive solution for generating Go project structures.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement the plugin system mentioned in the requirements to allow users to extend functionality.

2. Add support for generating different types of Go projects (e.g., microservices, REST APIs, GraphQL servers) as mentioned in the requirements.

3. Implement the caching system to store and reuse previously generated content, which could significantly improve performance for repeated generations.

4. Add functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions, as mentioned in the requirements.

5. Implement version control system integration (e.g., Git) to initialize the project repository automatically.

6. Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for containerization.

7. Implement a code linting and formatting step using tools like gofmt and golint.

8. Add an option to generate project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

9. Implement more comprehensive unit tests for the program itself.

10. Consider adding support for more AI models and implement a modular system for easy addition of new models in the future.

These enhancements would bring the program closer to fully meeting all the requirements specified in the original prompt and make it an even more powerful and flexible tool for Go project generation.
