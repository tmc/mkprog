<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-7) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Enhanced CLI functionality: The new program uses the cobra library for a more robust command-line interface, providing better flag handling and help documentation.

2. Configuration management: It incorporates the viper library for configuration file support, allowing users to set default values for flags.

3. Expanded AI model support: While the original program only supported Anthropic, the new version allows for multiple AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere).

4. Project templates: The new program introduces project templates (CLI tool, web server, library) for more tailored code generation.

5. Dry-run option: A new feature to preview generated content without creating files.

6. Concurrent file writing: The new program implements concurrent file creation for improved performance.

7. Progress indicator: A spinner is added to provide visual feedback during content generation.

8. Structured output: The AI-generated content is now returned as a JSON object, making it easier to process and create files.

9. Improved error handling: The new program has more comprehensive error handling and reporting.

10. Verbose output option: Added for more detailed logging when needed.

11. Custom templates: Support for custom template files has been added.

12. Better project structure: The new program itself has a more organized structure, separating concerns into different functions.

13. Improved documentation: The README.md file for the new program is more comprehensive, including detailed usage instructions and examples.

These enhancements make the new program more flexible, user-friendly, and capable of handling a wider range of project generation scenarios.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement a caching system to store and reuse previously generated content, as mentioned in the prompt but not yet implemented.

2. Add functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions, which was also mentioned in the prompt but not implemented.

3. Expand the test coverage by adding more unit tests for the main functionality.

4. Implement a plugin system to allow users to add custom AI models or project templates easily.

5. Add support for generating GitHub Actions workflows or other CI/CD configurations based on the project type.

6. Implement a feature to generate API documentation (e.g., Swagger) for web server projects.

7. Add an interactive mode where the program can ask follow-up questions to refine the project structure and implementation details.

8. Implement a validation step to ensure the generated code compiles and passes basic linting before writing to files.

9. Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml files for containerized applications.

10. Implement a feature to generate benchmark tests for performance-critical parts of the generated code.

These suggestions would further enhance the functionality and flexibility of the mkprog tool, making it an even more powerful solution for generating Go projects.
