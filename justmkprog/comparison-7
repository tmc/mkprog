<comparison>
The new program (mkprog) is an improved and more focused version of the original program. Here are the key differences and improvements:

1. Scope: The new program is specifically designed to generate Go projects based on user input, while the original program was more general-purpose.

2. Input handling: The new program accepts input from either stdin or a file, providing more flexibility.

3. Output organization: The new program allows specifying an output directory, making it easier to manage generated projects.

4. Flags: The new program implements more flags, including temperature, max-tokens, verbose logging, and goimports execution.

5. Error handling: Both programs use the run() pattern, but the new program has more comprehensive error handling and logging.

6. Code structure: The new program's code is more modular, with separate functions for reading input, writing files, and running goimports.

7. Documentation: The new program's README.md is more detailed and provides better usage instructions and examples.

8. Flexibility: The new program is designed to generate multiple files for a complete Go project, while the original program focused on generating a single program.

9. AI model usage: Both programs use the Anthropic model, but the new program implements it in a more straightforward manner.

10. File generation: The new program has a more robust system for generating multiple files from the AI output.

Overall, the new program is a more specialized and feature-rich tool for generating Go projects, while maintaining the core functionality of interacting with AI language models.

To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement a caching mechanism for AI responses to reduce API calls and improve performance for repeated or similar requests.

2. Add support for different AI models or providers, allowing users to choose between Anthropic, OpenAI, or other compatible models.

3. Implement a template system for common project structures, allowing users to specify a project type (e.g., CLI tool, web server, library) and generate appropriate boilerplate code.

4. Add a feature to automatically run "go mod tidy" after generating the project to ensure all dependencies are properly managed.

5. Implement a dry-run option that shows what files would be generated without actually creating them.

6. Add support for generating test files and basic test cases for the generated code.

7. Implement a feature to update existing projects by adding new files or modifying existing ones based on user input.

8. Add an option to generate a Dockerfile and basic CI/CD configuration files for the project.

9. Implement a plugin system to allow users to extend the functionality of the program with custom generators or post-processing steps.

10. Add an interactive mode that guides users through the project creation process with prompts for various options and configurations.

These suggestions aim to make the program more versatile, user-friendly, and aligned with modern Go development practices.
