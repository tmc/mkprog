<comparison>
The new program, mkprog, is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Expanded Functionality:
   - The new program offers more features, including support for custom templates, dry-run option, configurable project types, and progress indicators.
   - It implements a configuration file system for storing default values, which wasn't present in the original version.

2. Improved CLI Interface:
   - Uses the Cobra library for a more robust and feature-rich command-line interface.
   - Offers more command-line flags for greater customization.

3. Better Project Structure Generation:
   - Generates a complete project structure with multiple files, including documentation and configuration.
   - Uses AI to generate content for each file, providing a more comprehensive output.

4. Enhanced Error Handling and Concurrency:
   - Implements concurrent file writing using goroutines for improved performance.
   - Provides more detailed error handling and reporting.

5. Configuration and Flexibility:
   - Supports configuration files (YAML) for default values.
   - Allows selection of different AI models and project templates.

6. User Experience:
   - Implements a progress indicator (spinner) during content generation.
   - Provides a dry-run option for previewing generated content.

7. Code Organization:
   - The new program has a more modular structure with separate functions for different tasks.
   - Implements the ProjectStructure type for better organization of generated content.

8. Dependencies:
   - Uses additional libraries like Cobra, Viper, and spinner for enhanced functionality.

9. Documentation:
   - Provides a more detailed README with examples and configuration instructions.

Overall, the new mkprog program is more feature-rich, flexible, and user-friendly compared to the original version. It offers a more complete solution for generating Go project structures based on user descriptions.

<prompt-suggestion>
To further improve the mkprog program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement the caching system mentioned in the requirements to store and reuse previously generated content.

2. Add functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

3. Implement the plugin system to allow users to extend the program's functionality.

4. Add an interactive mode for users to provide project details step-by-step.

5. Implement version control system integration (e.g., Git) to initialize the project repository.

6. Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for containerization.

7. Implement a code linting and formatting step using tools like gofmt and golint.

8. Add an option to generate project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

9. Implement comprehensive unit tests for the program.

10. Enhance the AI prompt to generate more specific and tailored content for different project types.

11. Add support for multiple languages or frameworks within the generated projects.

12. Implement a feature to suggest and add commonly used Go libraries based on the project description.

These enhancements would make mkprog an even more powerful and versatile tool for generating Go projects.
