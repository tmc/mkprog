<comparison>
The new program (mkprog-7) is a significant improvement over the original program. Here are the key differences and enhancements:

1. Expanded functionality: The new program offers a more comprehensive set of features, including support for different project templates, custom templates, dry-run option, and configurable AI model selection.

2. Improved command-line interface: The new program uses the cobra library for a more robust and user-friendly CLI, with better flag handling and support for subcommands.

3. Configuration management: The new program implements a configuration file system using viper, allowing users to set default values for flags.

4. Concurrent file generation: The new program uses goroutines to generate and write files concurrently, improving performance for larger projects.

5. Progress indicator: A spinner has been added to provide visual feedback during project generation.

6. Modular structure: The new program has a more modular structure with separate packages for different functionalities (cmd, internal, pkg), making it easier to maintain and extend.

7. Enhanced error handling: The new program implements more comprehensive error handling and reporting throughout the codebase.

8. Flexibility: The new program supports different AI models and project templates, making it more versatile for various use cases.

9. Documentation: The README.md file for the new program is more detailed, providing better installation instructions, usage examples, and configuration options.

10. Code organization: The new program's main.go file is better organized, with clear separation of concerns between initialization, command execution, and project generation.

Overall, the new program is more feature-rich, flexible, and maintainable compared to the original program. It addresses many of the limitations of the original version and provides a more robust solution for generating Go project structures.

To further improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Implement the caching system mentioned in the prompt to store and reuse previously generated content.

2. Add comprehensive unit tests for the program, covering more scenarios and edge cases.

3. Implement the functionality to update existing Go projects based on new descriptions.

4. Add support for generating different types of Go projects (e.g., microservices, REST APIs, GraphQL servers) as mentioned in the prompt.

5. Implement the plugin system to allow users to extend the program's functionality easily.

6. Add an interactive mode for users to provide project details step-by-step.

7. Implement version control system integration (e.g., Git) to initialize the project repository.

8. Add support for generating Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for containerization.

9. Implement a code linting and formatting step using tools like gofmt and golint.

10. Add an option to generate project documentation using tools like GoDoc or pkgsite.

11. Implement dependency management functionality to manage and update project dependencies.

12. Profile the application and optimize resource usage, especially for large project generations.

These enhancements would bring the program closer to the full set of features described in the original prompt and make it an even more powerful tool for generating Go project structures.
